<p>The TadHack Hackathon event was hosted by Illinois Institute of Technology Real-Time Communications Lab. In the event, the sponsors offered every team to use their API technology to develop a useful software. We took this opportunity and used their technology to solve a problem that matters to people in daily emergency situations and communications. The OMANA Emergency Alert team hack was a multi-solution android emergency app to help people in their emergency situation. The app connects the user to a predefined contact and will instantly send a customized message to the contacts. Also, the app developed to send a front camera picture of the user to the contact list and play an alert sound to help the user in emergency situations. The user can enable/ disable this features according to their liking.</p>
